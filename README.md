Overview

CS Nexus is a campus-focused app that centralizes computer science events and resources for students. Built during SFU Surge's StormHacks 2025, it addresses the challenge of scattered CS event information across multiple platforms (Instagram, LinkedIn, email, Discord, posters, etc.) by providing a unified discovery experience.

Mission: Help CS students discover and engage with campus events, see which friends are attending, and help organizers gauge attendance for better event planning.

Inspiration

The app was inspired by attending SFU Surge's pre-hack resume workshop, where the value of on campus events became apparent when I got the chance to sit with my upperclassmen and reconstruct my resume from scratch, receiving feedback from people with experience, knowledge and a desire to share it. I the CS community at SFU can greatly benefit from staying up to date with all of the best campus events.
